## Sleep Efficiency Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Sleep Efficiency" dataset using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to sleep patterns and factors influencing sleep efficiency, including age, gender, bedtime, wakeup time, sleep duration, REM sleep percentage, deep sleep percentage, light sleep percentage, awakenings, caffeine consumption, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and exercise frequency. Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

## Description
The "Sleep Efficiency" dataset contains information about sleep patterns and factors influencing sleep efficiency. Each entry represents a unique individual's sleep data and includes the following columns:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each individual.
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Gender**: Gender of the individual.
- **Bedtime**: Time at which the individual goes to bed.
- **Wakeup time**: Time at which the individual wakes up.
- **Sleep duration**: Duration of sleep.
- **Sleep efficiency**: Efficiency of sleep.
- **REM sleep percentage**: Percentage of REM sleep.
- **Deep sleep percentage**: Percentage of deep sleep.
- **Light sleep percentage**: Percentage of light sleep.
- **Awakenings**: Number of times the individual awakens during sleep.
- **Caffeine consumption**: Amount of caffeine consumed.
- **Alcohol consumption**: Amount of alcohol consumed.
- **Smoking status**: Smoking status of the individual.
- **Exercise frequency**: Frequency of exercise.
